For this example, we can assume payment service should be responsible for storing
details of Payments Methods (Credit Card, Debit Card etc) that belong to a user and also
have a makePayment() Method.

Payment service should support 2 types of features:
1. Add a new payment
2. Make payment

For now u can incorporate 3 payment entities:
1. Credit Card (CC)
2. Debit Card (DC)
3. UPI

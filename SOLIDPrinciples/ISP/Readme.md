Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle ensures that class are not burdened with methods they don't need. It promotes better design by breaking larege, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, moe specific ones.

It improves maintainability, flexibility and testability by ensuring that classes only have the dependencies they actually require.

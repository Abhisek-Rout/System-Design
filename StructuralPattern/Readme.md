# Structural Pattern
Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger, more complex structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.
They focus on the structure of the system—how parts fit together—rather than the creation process (creational patterns) or interaction/behavior (behavioral patterns).

Examples of Structural Patterns
1. Adapter – makes incompatible interfaces work together.
2. Bridge – separates an abstraction from its implementation.
3. Composite – treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.
4. Decorator – dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.
5. Facade – provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
6. Flyweight – reduces memory usage by sharing common object state.
7. Proxy – provides a placeholder for another object to control access.

## Why the Name “Structural”?
The name comes from the fact that these patterns deal with the structure (composition) of classes and objects—just like architecture or building structures:
They describe how objects are combined to form larger structures.
They focus on the static composition of classes (inheritance) and the dynamic composition of objects (aggregation/composition).
The goal is to simplify the design structure while making it more extensible and flexible.

In short, they are called structural patterns because they provide ways to organize and relate entities in the system, just like structural engineering defines how parts of a building fit together.
